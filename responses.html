    <h2>1. Can you tell me about yourself?</h2>
    <ul>
        I'm an experienced Data Analyst with over five years in the field, working across diverse industries to extract insights that drive strategic decisions.<br> My core strengths lie in SQL, Excel, and Python for data manipulation, reporting, and automation.<br> I've also worked with C# and JavaScript, particularly when building dynamic, data-driven web applications or integrating dashboards into internal tools.<br> Throughout my career, I've developed end-to-end analytics solutions—from cleaning raw datasets to presenting actionable visual insights.<br> What sets me apart is my ability to not just work with data, but to translate it into stories that stakeholders can act on.<br> I'm now looking for an opportunity where I can bring both my analytical and technical development skills into a team that values innovation and measurable impact.
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Why do you want to work as a data analyst?</h2>
    <ul>
        I’ve always been drawn to patterns, logic, and problem-solving.<br> As a data analyst, I can combine those interests with real-world impact.<br> I love the idea that data, when properly analyzed, can reveal hidden opportunities or solve business challenges.<br> Whether it’s improving customer satisfaction or optimizing a process, I find it incredibly rewarding to contribute insights that drive better decisions.
    </ul>

    <h2>3. What do you know about our company and why do you want to work here?</h2>
    <ul>
        I know that your company is a leader in [industry], with a strong reputation for using innovation and data to improve customer experience.<br> I read about your recent initiative on [insert recent project or press release], which really shows your commitment to leveraging analytics for strategic growth.<br> I want to be part of a forward-thinking team where data is truly valued, and I feel like I could both learn a lot and contribute meaningfully here.
    </ul>

    <h2>4. What are your greatest strengths and weaknesses?</h2>
    <ul>
        My greatest strength is my attention to detail—especially when working with data.<br> I consistently double-check my queries and reports to ensure accuracy, and I always document my steps. I’m also strong at communicating complex findings clearly, even to non-technical stakeholders.<br><br>

        As for a weakness, I used to spend too much time trying to perfect every analysis, which affected my efficiency.<br> I've learned to set clear priorities and time-box tasks, which helps me balance precision with productivity.
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Describe a challenging project you've worked on and how you handled it.</h2>
    <ul>
        During my internship, I was tasked with analyzing sales performance across multiple regions using inconsistent Excel files.<br> The data had missing fields, different formats, and some duplicates.<br> It was overwhelming at first, but I developed a step-by-step plan: I standardized the format using Excel functions, cleaned the data with Power Query, and then imported it into Tableau for visualization.<br> After a week of careful work, I presented the findings to the team, helping them identify two underperforming regions and leading to a new sales strategy.<br> The experience taught me a lot about data hygiene and resilience under pressure.
    </ul>
